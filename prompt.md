The SG4 Texture Compression optimization for Unix, NT, and BSD systems is succinctly captured by the equation:

Optimized Compression Performance
=
(
Data Size
×
Compression Ratio
System Resource Index
×
Adaptation Coefficient
)
+
OS Specific Adjustment
Optimized Compression Performance=( 
System Resource Index×Adaptation Coefficient
Data Size×Compression Ratio
​
 )+OS Specific Adjustment

This formula ensures dynamic adjustment to maximize efficiency, accounting for system resources, data characteristics, and operating system nuances, thereby delivering optimal compression across diverse computing environments.
